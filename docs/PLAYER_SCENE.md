# Milestone: playable opening scene

Goal: `aid_script_ghoulies_chapter1_scene1_2playcam` is playable end to end on
the native path:

- the tutorial dialogue holds the script until A;
- Cooper walks under the left stick and attacks under the right stick;
- the imps fight back, take damage, die and are removed;
- the script passes its `scriptConditionId_NumberGhouliesAlive` gate
  ("Kill All");
- the scene ends into the next scene through the native transition.

Everything comes from translated retail functions, called in the retail order
from `frame_tick` and driven by retail state. Read `AGENTS.md` first; every rule
there applies. Host code that still shares the frame is listed in
`docs/LEGACY_HOST_CODE.md`. The previous chronological log (the first
playable-scene push, Oct 8–15) is in git history before this rewrite; don't
copy it forward.

## Retail frame order

`frame_tick` (`src/engine/game.cpp`) is `0x00033B50`:

1. `0x0011E4C0` (`script_pump`, `scene/scene.cpp`). In run state 1 or 2 it calls
   the scene tick `0x0011E7F0` (`scene_tick_pause_counter`): the cutscene stack
   `0x0004EBD0`, the dialogue `0x00057E60`, the fired script `0x00117140`
   (twice), the control list `DAT_0050E438`, **the actor update
   `0x00123020` over `DAT_00511B18`, then `0x00122FE0`**
   (`SceneActorServices::update_scene_actors`), then the script timers
   `0x00117100`.
2. `0x0011E640` (`run_scene_pass`): activation of new actors (`0x00123070`,
   `0x001231A0`, the one-shot first update `0x00123270`), effects, sounds and
   disposal, including the retired-actor removal `0x001232D0`.
3. Present `0x00033A90` → per camera slot `0x00033A20` (`present_views`) →
   `0x0011C240` per view: the actor bins `0x00121730` / `0x00121880` /
   `0x00121900` (passes 0/1) / `0x00121D40` (pass 2), effects, dialogue
   `0x00058150` and the text pools (`docs/NATIVE_SCENE_PRESENT.md`).

Each actor's update is its vtable +0x10. Players (factory type 5: Cooper class
4, the imps class 23, cameron) run `0x0002C2B0`, which ticks the mind (`0x34`
player, `0x35` cinema, `0x36` camera), the strategy, and the body (`0x27` imp,
`0x2A` Cooper, `0x28` camera). The body ticks its action children (body +0x744,
then +0x314) through their vtable +0x10, and walks its attack shapes against
other actors' segment probes (`0x0013F2C0` → `0x0013F7B0` → `0x0013FB50`).

## Current state (2026-10-16)

Verified against the source and live runs (`--player-opening`,
`--player-fight`, headless captures below).

Live and native:

- Scene start, markers, activation and teardown (`--scene-spawn`,
  `--scene-start`).
- The tutorial: the native dialogue holds the script until a fresh A edge, its
  button bat hops, and the script then waits at its "(next bit)" type-0xF gate.
- The play camera (cameron's director `0x000AA250`), the actor draw passes and
  the background `0x00042C10`. Cooper and the five imps are drawn.
- Actor updates run every frame (no hold). The imps walk and idle on the hall
  floor; Cooper walks under the left stick (state `0x8E` walk-alert).
- **Attacks.** The right stick makes Cooper's mind request an attack: the body
  selects factory type `0x73` `entityStateHit` (`entities/body_hit_state.cpp`),
  whose tick lunges toward the mind's target, turns toward it, plays the swing
  and picks the next action through the body's vtable +0x20/+0x2C.
- **Contacts and damage.** Cooper's attack shapes reach the imps' segment
  probes. The contact callback `0x0001F8C0` sends the imp message 0x15 and
  reports 0x41 back to Cooper's hit state. The imp's body takes the hit through
  `0x00020020` into the damage processor `0x00020DC0`: the reaction hit
  (`0x00021220` case 1/2) applies the damage, pushes the imp
  (`0x00022400`), and sends Cooper's body the push-back message 0x60.
- **The imp's hit reaction.** The reaction (`0x00024970`) picks a direction
  animation from body +0x268's rows (`hitfromFL`, ...) and enters its action
  row 0x7E (`actorstate_imp_hit`, factory type `0x74`). That state's tick
  (`0x00096890`) waits for the one-shot animation, then picks the next action
  (`0x00133F50`): at 1 health the imp goes to row 0x33
  (`actorstate_imp_dizzy`, factory type `0x64`).
- **Script tallies.** The hit message 0x6E reaches the script filter
  `0x00116950`, which tallies it (`0x00116C10` → `0x0012ACF0` →
  `0x0012AF80`, `scripts/script_event_tallies.cpp`) and drops it.
- **Hit effects.** Type-2 effect particles draw as world sprite quads
  (`0x000F0010` → `0x0005CF90`).
- **The alive count** (`0x00132680`) walks the native `DAT_00511B48` list
  (player `links[2]`, actor +0x944) and reads each body's +0x94.

Not live yet: no imp has died. See the frontier.

## Conventions

- **Address arenas.** Retail addresses held in native state resolve by range:
  resources from `0x40000000` (`resources.memory`), host heap blocks from
  `0x30000000` (`heap_address`, stable per pointer), scene objects from
  `0x10000000` (`scene.resolve_address`), and the XBE image below that
  (`image.memory`; attackdata rows, objparams, string tables). Body +0x84 holds
  an attackdata row address, so it resolves through the image, not as a scene
  object.
- **Target records.** `DAT_00545988` records are rebuilt each update pass by
  `refresh_mind_targets`: a 0x68-byte retail image per live attachment (+0x10
  the actor address, +0x14.. the record fields) at a heap-arena address. Mind
  +0x10 and +0x14 hold these addresses (`target_views`).
- **Messages.** Actor and body messages are 0x42-word records. A sender whose
  retail message is a short stack slot passes the retail stack words that
  follow it and zero-fills the rest.
- **Host structs on the message path** (`RuntimeContactNotice`,
  `RuntimeContactReport`) are converted to retail word layouts at the actor
  boundary; contact pools are bound to scene addresses while the message runs.
- **Vtables** of these classes are BSS filled by getters. When Ghidra has no
  reference, scan the XBE for the immediate (`0x00505940` → getter
  `0x00095740`) and export the range with `range-function-force:`.

## Test entry points

All take the game directory, e.g.
`build\Release\gbtg-transition-tests.exe OriginalFiles --player-fight`.
`gbtg-transition-tests` is not in the default build target; build it with
`--target gbtg-transition-tests`.

| Mode | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `--scene-spawn` | Opening markers create the retail actors and players; activation drains; contact round trip; teardown releases everything |
| `--scene-start` | The above plus the background, navigation, the 0x88/0x7D notices and the 0x6F player wait |
| `--player-opening` | Tutorial hold, bat hop, A edges, the "(next bit)" gate, Cooper walking (`cache/player_walk_check.bmp`), the imp fight music |
| `--player-fight` | The opening flow, then Cooper fights the imps (see Acceptance) |

Headless captures: `gbtg --headless --frames N --scene chapter1_scene1_2playcam
--width 640 --height 480 --screenshot FILE.bmp`.

## Known traps

- **Headless runs read the real keyboard.** Keys held on the machine (WASD,
  IJKL, A) reach the pad boundary; keep hands off during captures.
- **Bash heredocs mangle backslash escapes.** Python or shell heredocs turn
  `\n` in C++ string literals into real newlines. Use Write/Edit for literals.
- **Release builds have no debug info** (the `.pdb` beside the Release test is
  stale). For a crash stack, use the Debug or RelWithDebInfo build
  (`--config RelWithDebInfo --target gbtg-transition-tests`) with a temporary
  DbgHelp exception handler (`StackWalk64`) in the test, run with
  `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH` at that build directory, then remove it. A temporary
  catch that swallows an update error can leave the run hung or crashing
  later; don't read a later stop as the real one.
- Several callees of `0x0011E7F0` are still skipped with a comment rather than
  raising (`0x0013FFD0`, `0x000D0300`, `0x00049DE0`, `0x000F4A00`,
  `0x001128A0`, `0x0011B670`, `0x000F4560`, `0x0013FD60`, `0x00115BB0`,
  `0x001162F0`, `0x0011B7F0`, `0x0012AA70`, `0x001185E0`, `0x000FDDA0`,
  `0x000FD5C0`, `0x001083F0`). Check them when a gameplay effect is missing.
- Script conditions 23 and 24 and several script actions still walk the empty
  host `g_alt_links` instead of `DAT_00511B48`.
- **Class and state names can mislead.** The factory type table
  `DAT_0030D420` (getter, name, parent per 0xC-byte row) and the body state
  names `0x003390E4` look one entry off from what the rows do: the imp's
  `actorstate_imp_stand` / `_walk` / `_hit` / `_dizzy` objparams build types
  0x87 / 0x8E / 0x74 / 0x64, named StandAlert / WalkAlert / HitFurnace /
  DroneAppear. Go by the row's objparams and the getter, not the name.
- **Body +0x84 is not the only image record.** Image records resolve through
  `record_at(address, size)`; give the size you read (the body +0x268 direction
  rows are 8 bytes each, not the 0x24 of an attackdata row).
- **Register arguments.** `0x00020C80`'s last fallback passes the bare direction
  name in EBX, not the printed buffer. Check the instructions, not only the
  decompile, when a callee takes its name or output in a register.

## Frontier

Measured with `--player-fight` and a temporary skip of the digit draw
(removed). A clean run stops at fight frame ~125, on Cooper's first hit, at the
present-path stop: the hit imp's damage number. With the digits skipped, the
update path runs on until the imp's hit animation ends and it enters its dizzy
row, at the update-path stop below.

| Path | Stop | What it needs |
|---|---|---|
| Present (per view, `0x00028050` player draw → the body overlay's digits `0x0001E3E0`) | `scoreboard energy digits DAT_00545A80 are not loaded: 0x00132040 is not translated` | The damage numbers over a hit imp use the scoreboard's energy-number textures. They are loaded by `0x0012EE60` inside the scoreboard set-up `0x00132040`, which scene load `0x0011CBD0` calls (teardown `0x00132100` from `0x0011C5A0`). The native scene start skips it. `0x00132040` also runs `0x0012D180`, `0x0012D5F0`, `0x0012D930`, `0x0012FA50`, `0x0012FF80`, `0x00132350` (panels through `0x00130BB0`) and sets the HUD gate `DAT_005493E0`, which opens the untranslated per-view HUD draw `0x00132290`. So this step is the HUD milestone: set-up, teardown and draw together |
| Update (the imp at 1 health, row 0x33 `actorstate_imp_dizzy`) | `scene factory type 100 is not translated/installed` | Type `0x64` (getter `0x0008C940`, vtable `0x00505760`, parent 9, named entityStateDroneAppear): sizes `0x0008C920` (0x184 / 0x11C), constructor `0x0008C9A0`, destructor `0x0008CB30`, message `0x0008CEA0` (0x7C clears the three star slots), tick `0x0008CC40`; +0x14/+0x18 empty, +0x1C `0x0002B620`. The constructor spawns three orbiting star objects through the factory (`0x0008CEF0`: `0x000411A0`, `0x0008D230`, `0x00107520`, `0x00152BB0`, `0x0003B9D0`, `0x0003BB20`) and places them (`0x0008D0E0`: `0x00152BE0`, `0x0008D230`, `0x00105AA0`), then calls `0x0012A260`. The tick counts state +0x58 down, may call `0x00134720` (state +0x50) and the player-input branch (`0x001085F0`, `0x00109810`, `0x001088D0`), then ends through `0x001346B0`, `0x00122C70` and `0x00134060`. The destructor releases the stars (`0x00112D10`, message 0x80, `0x0003ED70`) and calls `0x0012A3D0`. Exports are in `cache/ghidra_frontier/` |

Behind those: the second hit (the imp dies at 0 health: the death action
through body vtable +0x4C, unbound in `SceneBodyMessages`), message 0x31
through the script filter (translated, untested live), removal `0x001232D0`,
the "Kill All" gate and the scene end.

## Work

1. The scoreboard/HUD milestone: `0x00132040` at scene load, `0x00132100` at
   teardown, and the per-view HUD draw `0x00132290`. Unblocks the damage
   numbers.
2. Type `0x64`, the imp's dizzy state, with its star objects.
3. Imp death and removal: the body death action (vtable +0x4C), message 0x31
   and the retired-actor removal `0x001232D0`.
4. The "Kill All" gate: `0x00132680` is bound; check it passes once the imps
   die.
5. The scene end: the fired script requests the next scene AID through
   `0x00117140` and the native transition takes over.
6. Imps fighting back: their fire strategy (`0x46`) attacks reach Cooper's
   body damage path.

## Acceptance

- `--player-fight` drives Cooper with the sticks, defeats every imp, requires
  the script to pass "Kill All" and saves readbacks along the way
  (`cache/player_fight_N.bmp`).
- Release and Debug build; `ctest`; the six transition suites (`--scene-start
  --scene-spawn --dialogue-resources --actor-loading --ghoulybox-decoder
  --scene-models`), `--player-opening`, `--player-fight`, `--title`,
  `--title-a`, `--attract`, `--goop`, `--ui`, `--audio-preparation`. Debug
  `--actor-loading` fails at `check_boot_pixel_shaders` on the unmodified tree.
- `gbtg --headless --frames 900` exits 0, with and without `--scene
  chapter1_scene1_2playcam`.
- Screenshots at the reference frames match or are better.
- `git diff --check` is clean; no temporary probes remain.

## Reference captures (2026-10-16, before the combat work)

`cache/player_ref/`:

| Capture | Screen |
|---|---|
| `opening_180.bmp` | The hall from behind Cooper; three imps on the floor, the staircase and portraits |
| `opening_300.bmp` | Same view a little later; the imps have moved |
| `opening_900.bmp` | The native tutorial page: Jeeves' head, "I suggest Sir uses the Left Thumbstick to move and HOLDS the Right Thumbstick…", the corner imps and the A-button bat |
| `player_opening_check.bmp` | `--player-opening` at frame 720: the tutorial page |
| `player_walk_check.bmp` | `--player-opening` after 120 frames of left stick: Cooper climbing the stairs |

`--player-fight` before this work stopped at frame ~60 of the fight with
"scene factory type 115 is not translated/installed".

## Checkpoints

### 2026-10-16: the imp's hit reaction

- Translated factory type `0x74` (`entities/body_hit_state.cpp`, installed in
  `body_state_actions.cpp`): sizes `0x00090410`, constructor `0x00096710`,
  destructor `0x000967F0`, tick `0x00096890` with the recovery pick
  `0x00133F50` and `0x00134060`. Its scorch `0x000965C0` (body +0x268 +0x19C
  above 1) and the goal-ring branch of `0x00134060` (`0x00028360`,
  `0x00135790`, `0x00135540`) raise when reached; neither is reached by the
  imps. Body vtable +0x30/+0x34 (`0x00026B00` / `0x00026BB0`) are bound for
  types 0x27 and 0x2A.
- Fixes on the way:
  - the damage direction rows were an empty host stand-in; `0x00024970` passes
    body +0x268 itself (+0 count, +4 rows in the image), and the animation name
    is printed into `DAT_00508EB8`;
  - `0x00020C80`'s last fallback looked up the printed buffer instead of the
    bare direction name (EBX), so imps never found `hitfromFL` and stayed in
    a looping animation;
  - the script filter `0x00116950` raised on every id outside its accepting
    arms. Ids without an arm are now dropped as in retail, and the 0x31, 0x6B,
    0x6E, 0x70 and 0xAF/0xB3 arms are translated (0x80, 0x83 and 0xB0 raise).
- Type-2 effect particles (`0x000F0010`) and the world sprite quad
  `0x0005CF90` with its depth mode `0x0005DFF0`. The recording device takes
  `SetVertexData2f` texture coordinates, and the presenter draws the `0x102`
  fixed format with its texture.
- `--player-fight` now stops at fight frame ~125 at the HUD digits (present
  path), with type `0x64` behind it on the update path (see the frontier). No
  imp has died yet.
- Tests play at 10% master volume (`AGENTS.md`, Test volume).
- Verified: Release and Debug build; ctest 6/6 in each; the six transition
  suites, `--player-opening`, `--title`, `--title-a`, `--attract`, `--goop`,
  `--ui` and `--audio-preparation` pass in both (Debug `--actor-loading` fails
  in `check_boot_pixel_shaders` as before). `--player-fight` fails at the
  frontier in both. Both 900-frame headless runs exit 0. The opening captures
  at 180, 300 and 900 and the `--player-opening` readbacks are pixel-identical
  to `cache/player_ref/`. The hit
  sparks were not seen in a capture: a clean run stops at the digits before
  the effect pass draws. Nothing here was compared with xemu.

### 2026-10-16: entityStateHit and the contact path

- Translated factory type `0x73` (`entities/body_hit_state.cpp`): sizes
  `0x00095720`, constructor `0x000957A0`, destructor `0x000958A0`, message
  `0x00095C90` (with `0x000961C0`, `0x00095E30`, `0x00095E70`, `0x00028C80`),
  tick `0x00095940` with `0x00095F30`, `0x00096260`, `0x00095EA0`,
  `0x0001D5B0`, `0x001013A0`, `0x00096060`, `0x000963E0`, `0x00096390`,
  `0x00134180`, `0x001346B0` and `0x0003CCB0`. Slots +0x14/+0x18 are the empty
  `0x001628B0`; +0x1C is `0x0002B620`.
- Body vtable +0x20/+0x2C are attached for types 0x2A (`0x00075B90`,
  `0x00075C30`) and 0x27 (`0x00026950`, `0x00026A90`).
- Fixes on the way:
  - the mind and the body handlers read body +0x84 as a scene object or as
    `body_resources[0]`; it is an attackdata row in the image;
  - the player mind's message context kept a stale copy of mind +0x10's target;
  - `DAT_00433C9C` has 0x48 rows, not 0x10;
  - the damage processor's push keys were empty (`DAT_00217DB0`, read by
    `0x000239C0` / `0x00023A50`; the amount keys of `0x000238E0` start at
    `DAT_00217DE8`), and its `attributes` were actor +0x964 instead of body
    +0x268;
  - the alive count read the empty host `g_alt_links`;
  - the damage-number overlay dereferenced the unloaded `DAT_00545A80`; it now
    raises.
- Contact path: player segment probes resolve to their player; `0x0001F8C0` is
  bound with the hit-stat tables `DAT_0053E528` / `DAT_00524E2C`; the imp body
  builds its 0x15 views (contact pool, the attacker's body and attack row, the
  imp's bound, the attacker's damage entry), and Cooper's body takes the 0x60
  push-back with its source view.
- `--player-fight` is now the acceptance test (see Acceptance). It fails at the
  frontier above on Cooper's first hit (type 0x74), with the scoreboard digits
  behind it.
- Next: type `0x74`, then the HUD milestone.
- Verified: Release and Debug build; ctest 6/6 in each; the six transition
  suites, `--player-opening`, `--title`, `--title-a`, `--attract`, `--goop`,
  `--ui` and `--audio-preparation` pass in both (Debug `--actor-loading` fails
  in `check_boot_pixel_shaders` as on the unmodified tree). `--player-fight`
  fails at the frontier in both. Both 900-frame headless runs exit 0. The
  opening captures at 180, 300 and 900 and the `--player-opening` readbacks are
  pixel-identical to `cache/player_ref/`. Nothing here was compared with xemu.
